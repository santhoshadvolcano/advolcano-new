          <div className="prose prose-slate max-w-none text-slate-700">
            <p className="mb-4">
              Company makes no guarantee or representation as to the quantity and/or quality of visits, impressions, circulation, or other usage of Third Party Services or Company's Websites of the advertisement, or as to the use of any particular tracking or information-gathering devices, unless Company expressly agrees otherwise in writing.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Advertiser and Agency acknowledge and agree that advertisements and ad impressions Published on Third Party Services and Company's Websites may be viewed by end users located in any Country.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              In addition, all impressions and/or other measurements of advertisements for Company's Websites and all impressions and/or other measurements of advertisements for a Third Party Service shall be based on Company's calculations shall be based solely on Company's calculations for its Websites, unless Company expressly agrees otherwise in writing.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Company, Company will bill for the advertising on Company's Websites based on such Websites' own ad delivery numbers ("Company Numbers"); and, if applicable, Company has the right to bill for advertising in Third Party Services based on its Company Numbers.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              In the event Company and Advertiser agree in writing that certain ads will be billed based on ad delivery numbers other than the applicable Website's own Company Numbers (i.e., third party numbers), Company will bill for such ads based on such third party numbers as long as the delivery discrepancy from third party numbers and Company Numbers is less than ten percent (10%). In the event that a difference of ten percent (10%) or more arises, both Company and Advertiser/Agency agree to use reasonable efforts to reconcile the difference and come to a mutually agreed upon solution.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              If an agreement cannot be reached or if Advertiser fails to provide its third party ad delivery numbers within five (5) business days after the end of its ad campaign, Company reserves the right to bill Agency/Advertiser at a delivery rate of one hundred percent (100%) of Company Numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
              For purposes of clarification, Advertisers that request a special billing schedule or an upfront bill will not receive refunds/adjustments in the case of under-delivery of guaranteed impressions (if applicable). Company reserves the right to temporarily shut down all advertising orders in case of irregular changes in the buyout, including, but not limited to, greatly increased bids.
